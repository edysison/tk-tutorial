```

# Notes
Since I did not have access to the test product's codebase, I was unable to fully leverage my abilities. As a result, there are still improvements to be made in order to make these automated tests more robust and functional. Some of the enhancements that can be made include:

- Replace class selectors with data attributes for more reliable targeting.
- Add component-level testing for better isolation and reliability.
- Integrate the tests with the projectâ€™s Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
